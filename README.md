# What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained knowledge and experience in several areas:

- DOM manipulation: I learned how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to dynamically update and modify elements on the web page.

- Event handling: I learned how to handle user interactions, such as button clicks, by using event listeners and callback functions.

- Random number generation: I learned how to generate random numbers within specific ranges using JavaScript's Math.random() function.

- Array manipulation: I gained experience in working with arrays, including iterating over arrays and selecting random elements.

- CSS styling and responsiveness: I learned how to apply CSS styles to create an appealing and user-friendly interface. I also learned how to make the application responsive by using media queries to adapt the layout and font sizes to different screen sizes.
